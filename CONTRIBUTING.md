# Contributing Guidelines
### Terms and Conditions
1. Register anytime between September 26 and October 31 [(click here!)](https://hacktoberfest.com/)
2. Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)
3. Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total
4. Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
5. The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest t-shirt (Sadly, from 2023 they doesn't sent any t-shirt prize anymore).

Feel free to do your own code. Our mission is to get clean code (you can pull everything you like!)
But of course, please don't just print "Hello world" or anything like that!

I will accept any source code that can run (it's okay if it had some bug, at least it can run).
All bugged code will be fixed by other people, but please mention the bug so it will be more challenging.
